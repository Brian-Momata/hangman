# hangman
Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

This project is part of the The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum.

# Instructions
This Hangman game selects a word between 5-12 letters long from a text file. On each turn, you can guess one letter. To win, you must find all the letters in the word before using 8 incorrect guesses.

In addition, you may choose to save a game. At the beginning of each game, you can choose to load a previously saved game.

You can download this repository and run hangman.rb in the command line.
